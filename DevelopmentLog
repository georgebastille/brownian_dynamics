2012/12/01 13:12 - Landscape generated from Gaussian distributed RNG and spherical array.
				 - Currently not implemented: Periodic boundary mirrors, rescaling of epsilon.
		   14:54 - Config file reading/writing/parsing working
		   15:35 - Particle initialisation tested
		   17:06 - Initial dynamics loop implemented with Metropolis step
2012/12/03 12:01 - Implemented rescaling of landscape to reflect the desired value of epsilon
		   15:43 - The state vector file does not need to be updated with the landscape and the initial particle positions each time
		           The only part which changes is the current time and the current particle positions
		           In fact, once the landscape has been created, epsilon is not needed anymore.
		   18:14 - Implemented periodic boundary in landscape and in particle positions
2012/12/04 19:06 - Starting to implement the state persistence routines, wondering how I can save the random seed
                   turns out that using a custom RNG might be the best way to go. DOn't worry about it for
                   now but maybe get a copy of Mersenne Twister and add it to the random factory.
